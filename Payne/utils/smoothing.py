    """
    :param wave:
        The wavelength vector of the input spectrum, ndarray.  Assumed
        angstroms.

    :param spec:
        The flux vector of the input spectrum, ndarray

    :param resolution:
        The smoothing parameter.  Units depend on ``smoothtype``

    :param outwave:
        The output wavelength vector.  If None then the input wavelength vector
        will be assumed, though if min_wave_smooth or max_wave_smooth are also
        specified, then the output spectrum may have different length than spec
        or wave, or the convulution may be strange outside of min_wave_smooth
        and max_wave_smooth.  Basically, always set outwave to be safe.

    :param smoothtype:
        The type of smoothing to do.  One of:

        * `vel` - velocity smoothing, ``sigma`` units are in km/s
          (dispersion not FWHM)
        * `R` - resolution smoothing, ``sigma`` is in units of \lambda/
          \sigma(\lambda) (where \sigma(\lambda) is dispersion, not FWHM)
        * `lambda` - wavelength smoothing.  ``sigma`` is in units of \AA
        * `lsf` - line-spread function.  Use an aribitrary line spread
          function, which must be present as the ``lsf`` keyword.  In
          this case ``sigma`` is ignored, but all additional keywords
          will be passed to the `lsf` function.

    :param min_wave_smooth:
        The minimum wavelength of the input vector to consider when smoothing
        the spectrum.  If None then it is determined from the output wavelength
        vector and padded by some multiple of the desired resolution.

    :param max_wave_smooth:
        The maximum wavelength of the input vector to consider when smoothing
        the spectrum.  If None then it is determined from the output wavelength
        vector and padded by some multiple of the desired resolution.

    :param inres: (optional)
        If given, this parameter specifies the resolution of the input.  This
        resolution is subtracted in quadrature from the target output
        resolution before the kernel is formed.

        In certain cases this can be used to properly switch from resolution
        that is constant in velocity to one that is constant in wavelength,
        taking into account the wavelength dependence of the input resolution
        when defined in terms of lambda.  This is possible iff:
        * ``fftsmooth`` is False
        * ``smoothtype`` is ``"lambda"``
        * The optional ``in_vel`` parameter is supplied and True.

        The units of ``inres`` should be the same as the units of
        ``resolution``, except in the case of switching from velocity to
        wavelength resolution, in which case the units of ``inres`` should be
        in units of lambda/sigma_lambda.

    :param in_vel: (optional)
        If supplied and True, the ``inres`` parameter is assumed to be in units
        of lambda/sigma_lambda. This parameter is ignored **unless** the
        ``smoothtype`` is ``"lambda"`` and ``fftsmooth`` is False.

    :returns flux:
        The smoothed spectrum on the `outwave` grid, ndarray.
